7/5/2024,HI Comp @ AAMAS 2024,Dream Team,T1. Research HI Team,"In this scenario, the collaboration between a scientist and an AI-driven virtual agent results in exceptional productivity and groundbreaking discoveries regarding neurodegenerative diseases. The teamâ€™s effectiveness is rooted in optimal exploitation of several key quality attributes:
 
 Skills Comprehensiveness (Q6) and Proactivity (Q11): The AI's advanced capabilities in data mining and pattern recognition complement the scientistâ€™s deep understanding of neurobiology. The AI not only follows the scientist's directives but also proactively suggests new avenues of research based on emerging trends in data, such as unexplored genetic markers that could be linked to disease pathways.
 Effective Communication and Coordination Mechanisms (Q4 & Q5): Robust communication tools and protocols ensure that findings are shared in real-time, allowing the scientist to make swift, informed decisions about experimental design and further investigations. This synergy allows the team to adapt quickly to new information, enhancing their collective efficiency.
 Team Structure Transparency (Q1) and Members Identifiability (Q2): Clear definitions of roles within the team prevent overlap and ensure that each member can focus on tasks that best suit their expertise. This clarity supports efficient task distribution and accountability.
 Objectives and Norms Transparency (Q9 & Q12): With clearly articulated objectives and norms, both team members understand the ultimate goal of their work and the standards to which they are held. This alignment keeps the team focused and cohesive, driving them towards shared success.
 Autonomy (Q10): The AI's ability to operate independently within defined parameters allows the scientist to delegate substantial parts of the data analysis process, freeing her to concentrate on strategic decisions and complex biological validation.
 
 The culmination of these efforts is a successful identification of a novel therapeutic target for neurodegeneration, leading to significant scientific publications and advancements in treatment strategies. The stakeholders express high satisfaction due to the teamâ€™s achievements, which not only meet but exceed the project's goals.",T1. Research HI Team,"In the worst case scenario, the lack of crucial quality attributes leads to a breakdown in collaboration between the scientist and the AI-driven virtual agent, resulting in a significant setback in research progress:
 
 Lack of Skills Comprehensiveness (Q6): The AI lacks crucial updates in its algorithms, which results in outdated or irrelevant data processing, and the scientist is not adept at troubleshooting AI systems, leading to persistent technical issues and data misinterpretation.
 Poor Communication and Coordination (Q4 & Q5): The team suffers from inadequate communication tools and unclear protocols, causing delays in information sharing and frequent misunderstandings. This inefficiency is compounded by poorly defined coordination mechanisms, leading to duplicated efforts and wasted resources.
 Weak Team Structure and Member Identifiability (Q1 & Q2): The roles and capabilities of the team members are not clearly defined or understood, leading to confusion over task ownership and responsibilities. This ambiguity results in critical tasks being neglected or improperly handled.
 Objectives and Norms Transparency (Q9 & Q12): The lack of a clear understanding of the teamâ€™s objectives and norms leads to misaligned efforts. The team members operate with different goals in mind, and without a common standard of practice, their actions often contradict rather than complement each other.
 Autonomy Without Proper Oversight (Q10): The AI operates too independently without adequate input and oversight from the scientist, leading to unchecked errors and a drift away from relevant research focus. This misplaced autonomy exacerbates the situation as the AI lacks the capability to self-correct or align its operations with the scientific goals.
 As a result, the project fails to achieve any meaningful outcomes, resulting in wasted time and resources. Stakeholder dissatisfaction is high, and the potential for significant advancements in understanding or treating neurodegenerative diseases is squandered.
 
 These expanded scenarios provide a comprehensive view of how critical the integration and proper management of quality attributes are in determining the success or failure of collaborative human-AI endeavors."
7/5/2024,HI Comp @ AAMAS 2024,MarkBaz,T1. Research HI Team,"In a bustling pharmaceutical laboratory, a team of researchers gathered around a conference table, their faces illuminated by the glow of computer screens displaying complex molecular structures and scientific literature. Among them stood Dr. Emily Chen, a seasoned neuroscientist leading the charge in the company's quest to combat neurodegeneration, and her AI-driven collaborator, AlphaFold enabling simulations of protein behaviour that would otherwise require days or weeks of assistants for each protein. Having had extensive training in how AlphaFold works, Emily and her AI assistant have a high level of Autonomy and Team Structure Transparency enabling independence of team members to explore different aspects of the problem. 
 
 The team's objective was clear: to identify proteins with the potential to inhibit neurodegeneration. Dr. Chen turned to AlphaFold, the revolutionary AI system renowned for its unparalleled accuracy in predicting protein structures. With AlphaFold's assistance, the team aimed to analyse the intricate folds and binding sites of proteins implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Whilst Emily and her AI team have a high level of mutual dependency, she is able to maximise her time usage by reducing the time taken to fold proteins and maximise her research output. Her team extends to IT research support staff, who meet weekly over video call to discuss how her use of AlphaFold can be maximised. Recently, they have developed a new sensor for her lab which can directly communicate with AlphaFold, developed purely due to the effective communication between the team. In these weekly meetings, team processes are discussed and rigorously criticised with the intention of finding optimisations that may lead to breakthroughs. The high quality of the group process has led to less time wasted on false-positive experiments.
 
 As Dr. Chen fed protein sequences into AlphaFold's neural network, the AI swiftly generated high-fidelity 3D models of their structures, unveiling hidden intricacies invisible to the human eye. With each prediction, AlphaFold provided valuable insights into the structural dynamics of the proteins, highlighting potential sites for therapeutic intervention. As Dr. Chen is confident in the quality of AlphaFoldâ€™s task performance; it gives her greater freedom to spend her time on the proteins that present the best results. However, Dr. Chen is also aware of the weaknesses of AlphaFold, and submits her experiments earlier in the day to ensure they are completed before the end of the day.
 
 Back at Dr. Chen's workstation, AlphaFold unveiled a protein structure with a unique binding pocket predicted to modulate neurodegenerative pathways. Excitement rippled through the laboratory as the team recognized the potential significance of their discovery. Armed with this newfound insight, Dr. Chen and her colleagues delved deeper into the literature, cross-referencing AlphaFold's predictions with a large language model's summaries to uncover additional evidence supporting the protein's role in neuroprotection.",T4. Cybersecurity Response Team,"Following months of increased denial-of-service attacks from bad actors external to our organisation, a previously unknown zero-day vulnerability has allowed the balance to swing into the attackers favour. To save costs in this organisation, jobs requiring AI inference are performed in the cloud. 
 A large degree of complacency is apparent in our organisation, and no contingency planning has been done despite the continuing denial-of-service attacks. The team is heavily independent, and humans rely significantly on the AI to identify which attacks require attention first. Furthermore, the humans work from multiple offices across different time zones, utilising an internal tool for communication which utilises the internet.
 At the onset of the attack, the attack partially removes the ability for the organisation to access the internet, removing the AI agents to help in the problem as they are run on external servers and for our humans to communicate between offices. This reduces the team's skill comprehensiveness, as human agents have not been trained to complete the jobs that the AI agents are unable to do, and the humans are not able to communicate to describe which tasks they are working on, wasting precious time when members are unknowingly working on the same problem.
 The humans are able to partially restore the AI, but the zero-day vulnerability is one which the AI agents have not been exposed to before. This out of distribution attack means that their inferred best actions are no longer the correct decision, and to reduce their exposure, the human members are required to shadow the agent's actions. As the human members are required to cover where the AI agents are failing to perform, they quickly become overwhelmed due to the increasing workload. This leads to frustration and a breakdown of team communication, further reducing their effectiveness and efficiency. Mistakes quickly lead to an even more increased workload, causing complete team dysfunction.
 After a period when the attack is finally mitigated, the dust settles to reveal that customer and employee data has been stolen, leading to legal liabilities for our organisation."
7/5/2024,HI Comp @ AAMAS 2024,Kawaii,T2. Child Education Team,"Competence and interdependencies: The educational therapist knows how to communicate with the child experiencing multiple learning difficulties and knows how to overcome their learning challenges. The remedial teacher knows how to provide the material, given consistent feedback and monitor progress of children. The assistant robot can be utilized to communicate with the child and follow the materials suggested by the remedial teacher. It can provide the analysis of those material and students' learning rate to improve the program. Consequently, the remedial teacher can revise their material and program. The educational therapist can guide the assistive robot in individual communication with the student. In contrast to human teachers, robots are capable of keeping track of each interaction and have high computational capacity, while teachers know human values and psychology better.",T3. Healthcare Diagnosis Team,The effectiveness isn't so good because her condition has not improved.
7/5/2024,HI Comp @ AAMAS 2024,Zebra State University,T4. Cybersecurity Response Team,"Use case: We must address an increasing series of DoS attacks on governmental websites originating from countries outside of the jurisdiction of local authorities.
 
 We can break down the best case scenario into each of the smaller objectives required to address the problem and consider the best route of action at each point.
 
 The first step in dealing with the DoS attacks is identification of the problem, for which skills comprehensiveness is particular important. Since cybersecurity attacks are inherently unpredictable and constantly evolving, having a team comprised of members whose expertise can cover as many potential scenarios as possible is vital. In the best case scenario, the problem will immediately be identified because we have at least one team member that has some familiarity with the type of incoming attack and begin the process of dealing with that attack. Agents will hold a particular strength in identifying attacks quickly, while humans will hold strength in noticing novel and unseen patterns.
 
 Once we have identified the attacks, the best case team will be very quickly able to triage and identify the best suited analyst to take and in-depth look and address the issue. For this, team structure transparentcy will be key in getting that information to the right people or agents in a timely manner. Time is of essence, and both humans and AI agents will coordinate and delegate efficiently while communicating those needs without friction.
 
 After the method of approach has been established, the team will self-correct and learn for future attacks. They will evolve as a human immune system does and become more effective against similar methods. This is critical in the case of cybersecurity, as once the security weakness is exploited by one malicious agent, it is far more suceptible to be used by others. For this, a good quality of group processes is necessary.",T4. Cybersecurity Response Team,"In a DoS attack, whenever a threat is detected, the first step is to triage and allocate the threat to a team member to look into the threat and fix it.
 
 In a worst case scenario, a triage team member is not aware of the division of team and responsibilities. This will lead to the task being assigned to the wrong member. The assigned team member is unaware of the team structure, team members and their skills and responsibilities, including their own. As such, the assigned member attempts to tackle the threat without the correct subject-matter expertise, leading to longer cycle time and lower productivity.
 
 Under the same team, there exists a lot of interdependence and bad communication and team hierarchy. The team member has to go through their managers before finally reaching out to the correct team to tackle the threat. The team has a lot of interdependence and so the threat goes through several members. Each member is individually responsible for a small part and the threat ends up going through several members before getting to the subject matter expert that can add the fix.
 With too much team communication, and minimal autonomy, the AI will not be able to take quick actions and is therefore not properly utilized in terms of speed and data processing capabilities.
 
 In a cybersecurity team, members (human), without proper alignment of norms (team practices), may end up not finalizing work properly, leading to confusion between members and incorrect hand-off. This will inherently lead to tasks not being correctly closed and longer processes.
 
 Without clear objectives, the team end up closing tickets by stopping parts of the system instead of actually tackling the core problem and ensuring the vulnerability is tackled."
7/5/2024,HI Comp @ AAMAS 2024,LouLu,T1. Research HI Team,"The best case scenerio is Case T1. We select three properties that the four cases differ from each other most: Boundedness, competence and normativity. Reasons for choosing T1 as best case are as follows:
 
 1. For Boundedness: Clear role delineation, smaller team size aiding identifiability
 2. For Competency: The Research HI Team has a scientist who understands and interprets professional medical terminologies and an AI-driven virtual agent that can quickly sift through numerous online datasets and literature. The spectrum of individual skills covers the goal comprehensively. The AIâ€™s transparency about potential and lack for subjective scientific discernment should be appreciated by the scientist.
 3. For Normativity: This team operates in a highly complex environment of drug discovery where shared understanding and adjustment behavior are vital. Scientists and AI would need to establish and understand norms to make sense of diverse data sets and agree upon interpretations. Despite the high stakes, direct human interaction mainly involves a single scientist, which may limit opportunities for norm transparency and adjustment. However, it is still vital for both entities to adhere to a common regulatory and ethical guidelines.",T3. Healthcare Diagnosis Team,"The worst case is T3. The 4 properties we choose to score the cases are boundedness, competency and normativity as the cases differ from each other most on these 4 properties. Reasons for case T3 being the worst are as follows:
 1. For boundedness: Hierarchical structure and varying levels of authority may affect structural transparency and member identifiability.
 2. For competency: The Healthcare Diagnosis Team's skills in medical diagnostics, when combined with AI's data-driven insights, should cover the objective. However, the disparate symptoms of the patientâ€™s case present a demanding task which could require specialist competencies yet unaccounted for. The AI algorithmâ€™s ability to be transparent about its lines of reasoning and limitations could be a potential issue.
 3. For normativity: While shared understanding is important here, medical norms are relatively well-established and less likely to require significant adjustment on a case-by-case basis. However, when facing complex cases, the team must remain mindful of and adjust to the ethical, procedural, and diagnostic norms."
7/5/2024,HI Comp @ AAMAS 2024,Piha,T2. Child Education Team,"The human experts use their expertise to design the robot to teach and interact with the child. The robot leverages its strengths to be able to continuously monitor many features of the child that the teachers wouldn't be able to do. For instance, the robot can track many cues of the child and compare to baseline, for instance their tiredness level and emotions. The robot can also track things such as the child's average reading speed, and how recently they've seen each word to properly do spaced repetition. The teachers can look at these trends and use their expertise to figure out what's going on. 
 
 The success relies on the robot being designed with the correct level of proactivity and autonomy. For instance, it can autonomously take low stakes actions like tracking new metrics and alerting the teachers of new trends. It also relies on the transparency of strengths and weaknesses-- the humans need to be calibrated about the quality of the data they see. Finally, it relies on communication mechanisms-- the robot should be able to alert the humans of low, medium, and high urgency deviations in trends.",T2. Child Education Team,"The scenario comprises a team of human experts designing a curriculum for the child based on the observations that the robot has done while a human w teaching the child. The robot learns from the human how to take care of the teaching on its own, so that many children can obtain a personalised educatic The robot reports the human after each lesson, explaining issues and proposing new opportunities to improve during the next lessons. There are many cases in which different qualities play a role. If humans and robots do not share a common understanding and they do not coordinate (interdependency). the task performance will suffer. Furthermore, it is important to find a proper balance in the proactivity of the robot, if the robot is not autonomous it might become useless, if it is really autonomous it can be harmful (mentally and physically). |"
7/5/2024,HI Comp @ AAMAS 2024,AR_TEAM,T2. Child Education Team,"The robot becomes a real study buddy of the child, knows how to motivate and reward the child. Also takes into account the child needs to have social interactions with other children and family, and also compliments the child when it is doing well on these aspects. The robot becomes a mediator in the teamâ€¦",T2. Child Education Team,"Given the problems of Alex, auditory and dylexia (which we assume have been professionally tested) this affects the learning performance in different subjects. 
 The team met to set the goals and the learning activities for next week. The teacherâ€™s ambition is that Alex performs at average class level for all subjects because she thinks this is feasible, given that Alex is doing well on some subjects. The educational therapist is a believer of the Bloom theory. The robot of not actively involved in the decision, is was considered as a tool that can present learning material is different formatâ€™s , is not adaptive and needs to be instructed with a weakly schedule. During the team meeting Alex was playing with the robot. The teamâ€™s purpose is set to be the performance on tests (class grading) 
 
 Q11 The scenario doesnâ€™t take the well-being of the child into account, itâ€™s intrinsic motivation. The robot is not pro-active nor adaptive. 
 The goals are too short term, there is no feedback mechanism to test if the goals are realistic. It doesnâ€™t measure anything on the happiness of Alex, nor which strategies for presenting the material are effective.
 Q1. Regarding team structure, the robot and the child are not considered as equal participants in the team. Q8.The set objective is not relevant for the child. Q16 the long term effect is missing as well as the satisfaction of the child."
